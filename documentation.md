## 3. Approach: Software Development Models

### 3.1 Comparison of Development Models

| Model         | Time | Quality | Cost | Docs | Extens. | Scale | Sec/Comp | Total | Avg           |
| ------------- | ---- | ------- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Build-and-Fix | 6    | 3       | 3    | 1    | 3       | 2     | 2        | 20    | **2.9** |
| Waterfall     | 3    | 6       | 4    | 9    | 4       | 5     | 7        | 38    | **5.4** |
| Spiral        | 5    | 8       | 4    | 8    | 7       | 7     | 8        | 47    | **6.7** |
| Incremental   | 8    | 9       | 7    | 7    | 9       | 8     | 9        | 57    | **8.1** |
| Rapid Proto.  | 9    | 7       | 6    | 5    | 6       | 6     | 6        | 45    | **6.4** |

Abbrev: Docs = Documentation, Extens. = Extensibility, Scale = Scalability, Sec/Comp = Security & Compliance; scores 0–10 (higher is better).

The comparison shows that Incremental provides high flexibility with changes between increments, risks addressed per increment, testing after each increment, regular customer feedback, moderate documentation, and fast time‑to‑market for a working MVP—making it the best fit for RestoSam. Waterfall offers clear, document‑driven discipline but low flexibility, testing largely at the end, and longer time to market; it is suitable when requirements are fixed and compliance documentation is paramount. Spiral emphasizes strong risk management and high quality via iterative elaboration, but adds process overhead and cost, so it fits large internal projects with high risk. Rapid Prototyping validates requirements very quickly and aligns to customer needs early, but it can encourage throwaway or shortcut code and lighter documentation, which may hurt maintainability and compliance if not controlled. Build‑and‑Fix may be fast for trivial tasks, but it is unsuitable for a non‑trivial, compliant system due to poor documentation, quality, and security control.

### 3.2 Selected Model

The Incremental Development Model has been selected for the RestoSam project.

### 3.3 Alternative Approach

An alternative approach would be the Waterfall Model, which follows a sequential design process where progress flows downward through phases like conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, implementation, and maintenance.

### 3.4 Justification for Not Choosing Other Models

The Waterfall Model was not selected because it requires complete requirements upfront, which is challenging for restaurant systems where user needs frequently change. Testing only occurs at the end of development, increasing risk of major issues. No working software is delivered until the final phase, delaying business value realization. Changes are expensive and difficult to implement once a phase is complete.

### 3.5 Model Benefits

The Incremental Model provides several advantages including early delivery of value where basic functionality like table booking and ordering can be deployed early. Risk reduction occurs as issues are identified and resolved in smaller increments. Flexibility allows changes to be incorporated based on user feedback. Stakeholder satisfaction is maintained through regular deliveries that keep engagement and allow for course corrections.

### 3.6 Benefits of the Selected Model

The selected Incremental Model provides business value as restaurants can start using core booking functionality while additional features are developed. Quality assurance is ensured as each increment undergoes testing, guaranteeing quality at every stage. The model accommodates the dynamic nature of restaurant operations and customer preferences through adaptability. Cost control is achieved as budget and resources can be allocated more efficiently across increments.
