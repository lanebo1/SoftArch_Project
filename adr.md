# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture Selection

**Status:** accepted

**Date:** 2025-01-01

**Context:**
The RestoSam system needs to scale from supporting 1 restaurant to 10+ restaurants within several months, handling 150+ concurrent users per restaurant during peak hours. The system requires real-time data synchronization across mobile, web, and backend components. Current constraints include a 6-9 person development team, need for independent deployments, and requirement to support multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web). Key NFRs include high availability (99.9% uptime), sub-2-second response times for critical operations, and PCI DSS compliance for payment processing. Risks include technology stack complexity, inter-service communication overhead, and distributed system debugging challenges.

**Decision:**
We will adopt a microservices architecture using Spring Boot for Java services, with API Gateway for request routing, service mesh for inter-service communication, and container orchestration with Kubernetes. Services will be independently deployable with domain-driven design boundaries.

**Alternatives:**
1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Considered for simpler initial development but rejected due to scalability limitations and inability to scale individual components independently.
2. **Serverless Architecture**: Evaluated for automatic scaling but rejected due to cold start latency issues unacceptable for real-time restaurant operations and higher operational complexity for the team.
3. **Modular Monolith**: Considered as a middle ground but rejected because it doesn't provide the independent deployment capabilities needed for scaling from 1 to 10+ restaurants.

**Consequences:**
(+) Independent scaling and deployment of services
(+) Technology diversity (can use different stacks per service)
(+) Fault isolation and resilience
(+) Team autonomy and faster development cycles
(-) Increased operational complexity and monitoring overhead
(-) Distributed system debugging challenges
(-) Eventual consistency issues across services
(-) Higher infrastructure and DevOps requirements

# ADR-002: Database Technology Selection

**Status:** accepted

**Date:** 2025-01-01

**Context:**
The system requires handling structured transactional data (orders, users, payments), unstructured content (menu items, customer preferences, multimedia), and high-performance caching (table availability, frequently accessed data). Data consistency is critical for financial transactions while flexibility is needed for evolving menu structures and user preferences. The system must support real-time queries, complex analytics, and scale from 1 to 10+ restaurants. PCI DSS compliance requires secure data handling. Performance requirements include sub-2-second response times for critical operations.

**Decision:**
We will implement a hybrid data storage architecture with PostgreSQL as the primary relational database for transactional data, MongoDB for flexible document storage, and Redis for high-performance caching and session management.

**Alternatives:**
1. **Single PostgreSQL Database**: Considered for ACID compliance but rejected due to poor performance with unstructured data and lack of built-in caching capabilities.
2. **Single MongoDB Database**: Evaluated for flexibility but rejected due to weaker transactional guarantees needed for payment processing and complex relational queries.
3. **Traditional RDBMS Only**: Considered for maturity but rejected due to scaling limitations and inability to handle multimedia content efficiently.

**Consequences:**
(+) Optimal data storage for each data type
(+) Strong consistency for financial transactions
(+) Flexible schema for evolving requirements
(+) High-performance caching capabilities
(-) Increased operational complexity
(-) Data synchronization challenges
(-) Multiple technology stacks to maintain
(-) Higher infrastructure costs

# ADR-003: Frontend Technology Stack

**Status:** accepted

**Date:** 2025-01-01

**Context:**
The system requires native mobile apps for iOS and Android, a responsive web interface, and an admin dashboard. The application needs to handle real-time updates, complex user interactions, and offline capabilities. Development team has expertise in modern web technologies but limited mobile development experience. Budget constraints limit the ability to hire specialized mobile developers. The solution must provide consistent user experience across platforms and support rapid feature development.

**Decision:**
We will use React Native for cross-platform mobile development (iOS and Android) and React for web interfaces, with a shared component library and state management layer.

**Alternatives:**
1. **Native iOS/Android Development**: Considered for optimal performance but rejected due to higher development costs, longer time-to-market, and maintenance complexity with separate codebases.
2. **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**: Evaluated for unified codebase but rejected due to limited native device access and poorer user experience for complex restaurant interactions.
3. **Flutter**: Considered as alternative cross-platform solution but rejected due to team's existing React expertise and larger ecosystem of React libraries.

**Consequences:**
(+) Single codebase for mobile platforms
(+) Faster development and maintenance
(+) Consistent UI/UX across platforms
(+) Access to native device features
(-) Performance overhead compared to native apps
(-) Potential platform-specific limitations
(-) Dependency on React Native ecosystem stability
(-) Steeper learning curve for complex native integrations

# ADR-004: Development Methodology Selection

**Status:** accepted

**Date:** 2025-01-01

**Context:**
The project involves a 6-9 person cross-functional team with diverse skills (frontend, backend, mobile, DevOps, QA). Restaurant requirements are likely to evolve based on user feedback and market conditions. The system must be delivered incrementally with working software every 2-4 weeks. Regulatory compliance (PCI DSS) requires proper documentation and audit trails. The team operates in an agile culture with low bureaucracy. Timeline constraints require delivering MVP within months while maintaining quality and security standards.

**Decision:**
We will use Scrum as the primary development methodology with 2-4 week sprints, supplemented by DevSecOps practices for security and compliance integration.

**Alternatives:**
1. **Waterfall**: Considered for comprehensive documentation but rejected due to inability to handle changing restaurant requirements and delayed delivery of working software.
2. **Kanban**: Evaluated for continuous flow but rejected due to need for time-boxed deliveries and sprint-based planning for stakeholder management.
3. **XP (Extreme Programming)**: Considered for code quality practices but rejected due to team size constraints and lack of on-site customer availability.

**Consequences:**
(+) Adaptability to changing requirements
(+) Regular delivery of working software
(+) Clear roles and accountability
(+) Early identification and mitigation of risks
(-) Requires discipline for documentation
(-) Overhead of ceremonies for small team
(-) Need for Product Owner availability
(-) Sprint planning overhead
