or your project describe the most suitable:

1.  model of the software life cycle - Incremental

2.  methodology of software development - Scrum

Justify the choice. Make sure to strongly support your arguments.

1.  We chose incremental because it allows us to deliver versions of the
    > product stage-by-stage with each stage being fully functional and
    > then add more features during the next stage. We chose incremental
    > but not waterfall since in the incremental model testing will
    > happen after each stage, not after the fully developed project.

2.  We chose Scrum because it\'s designed for flexible and adaptive
    > development, which is crucial for restaurant systems where user
    > requirements frequently change. Scrum allows fast delivery of
    > value through short sprints (2-4 weeks), enabling the restaurant
    > to start using basic booking functionality early. It provides a
    > clear distribution of responsibilities between Product Owner,
    > Scrum Master, and development team. The main idea is that Scrum
    > focuses on delivering working software increments that provide
    > immediate business value to restaurant operations.\
    > \
    > XP we don't choose because this is a very inconvenient development
    > methodology and does not have the ability to parallelize
    > development.

The suggested aspects of the project to cover in your argumentation:

1.  Product/project type - Web & Mobile App

2.  Project scale - Medium size

3.  Team size 6-9 members (1 Team Lead&Scrum Master&Product Manager, 1
    > Web Frontend, 2 Backend, 1 Mobile, 1 DevOps, 1 SRE, 1 QA)

4.  Team competence Vue (JavaScript) & Vue Native + Kotlin + Spring
    > Boot + Golang + gRPC + PostgreSQL + MongoDB + Redis

5.  Business factors (e.g. bureaucracy) - Innovative culture, low level
    > of bureaucracy

6.  Artifacts necessity - working stages of MVP, updated documentation,
    > stable backend, stable frontend, stable mobile, stable test env

7.  Technological factors - Multi-platform (iOS, Android, Web),
    > Scalability and high availability, Security, CI/CD pipelines,
    > cloud deployments,
